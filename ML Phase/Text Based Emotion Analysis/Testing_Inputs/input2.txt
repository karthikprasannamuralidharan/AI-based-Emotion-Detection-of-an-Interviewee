How do you handle pressure situation ?

When faced with a pressure situation, I strive to stay focused and maintain a positive attitude. I believe in the importance of staying organized, breaking down each task into manageable steps, and taking breaks when needed, as this helps me work more efficiently and effectively. I also make sure to ask for help when needed, as getting a second opinion or an extra pair of hands can help reduce the pressure. Lastly, I practice self-care and take time to relax and regroup during stressful times.
